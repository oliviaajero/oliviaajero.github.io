    <u>Fluffiest Homemade Donuts Recipe</u>
	</head>
- 280 gr of  All Purpose Flour ( 2 cups + 3 tbsp flour)
- 40 gr Sugar ( 3 tbsp)
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1/4 tsp Nutmeg
- 1 egg
- 120 gr Whole Milk ( 1/2 cup ) ( Every flour absorbs liquids differently, so you may need an extra 2-3 tbsp of milk)
- 40 gr melted Butter ( 1/3 stick )
-  7 gr Dry Yeast ( 1 packet )
<u>Delicious Glaze Recipe</u>
- 250 gr Powdered Sugar ( 2 cups)
- 75 gr Butter ( 2/3 Stick )
- Milk depending how thin you like your glaze
- 1 tsp Vanilla
TIP : Donuts are best freshly made. However if you'd like to make these ahead of time, once cooled store the donuts in a ziplock bag or an air-tight container
      and just before serving pop them in the microwave for 30 seconds. They'll be as delicious as when theyâ€™d just been made.
