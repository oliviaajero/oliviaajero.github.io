    		Curriculum Standards
Because of student mobility, Texas has adopted curriculum standards that are to be used in all the state's public schools. The current standards, which outline what students are to learn in each course or grade, are called Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS).  The standards are adopted by the State Board of Education, after extensive input from educators and other stakeholders.

 Below are links to the current standards, as well as information about the adoption process:
